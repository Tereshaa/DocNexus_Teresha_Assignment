# DocNexus: Healthcare Workflow Automation Platform

Welcome to **DocNexus** ‚Äì a full-stack web application designed to make healthcare professionals‚Äô lives easier by automating the messy, manual parts of managing meetings, transcripts, and documents. This project is built with real-world deployment in mind, using modern best practices for both code and cloud.

---

## üöÄ What is DocNexus?

DocNexus is your all-in-one solution for:
- **Uploading and transcribing medical meeting audio/video**
- **AI-powered analysis** (sentiment, key insights, action items)
- **Generating professional PDF and PowerPoint reports**
- **Seamless CRM integration** (e.g., Salesforce)
- **Analytics dashboard** for actionable insights

It‚Äôs built to be robust, cloud-ready, and easy for teams to use and extend.

---

## üèóÔ∏è How is it Built?

**DocNexus** is a classic, scalable full-stack app:

```
DocNexus/
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/      # React frontend (Material-UI, modern UX)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/      # Node.js/Express backend (MongoDB, AWS S3, OpenAI)
```

### **Architecture Overview**

```mermaid

    User[User/Browser]
    Frontend[Frontend (React/Material-UI)]
    Backend[Express Backend]
    DB[(MongoDB)]
    S3[S3 Bucket]
    OpenAI[OpenAI]
    CRM[Salesforce/CRM]

    User -- Uses --> Frontend
    Frontend -- API Calls --> Backend
    Backend -- REST API --> Frontend
    Backend -- MongoDB --> DB
    Backend -- File Upload/Download --> S3
    Backend -- OpenAI API --> OpenAI
    Backend -- CRM API --> CRM
```

### **Frontend**
- **React** (with hooks, context, and Material-UI for a clean, modern look)
- **SPA routing** (works on any cloud host, including Render)
- **Responsive and accessible** (mobile-friendly, keyboard navigation)

### **Backend**
- **Express.js** REST API
- **MongoDB** (Mongoose models for transcripts, users, etc.)
- **AWS S3** for all file storage (no ephemeral storage headaches)
- **OpenAI** for transcription and analysis
- **Salesforce/CRM** integration (easy to extend to other CRMs)
- **Robust error handling, logging, and security (Helmet, CORS, rate limiting)**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup: Get Running in Minutes

**Prerequisites:**  
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- AWS S3 bucket (for file storage)
- OpenAI API key

### **1. Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DocNexus_Teresha_Assignment.git
cd DocNexus_Teresha_Assignment
```

### **2. Backend Setup**
```bash
cd server
cp env.example .env   # Fill in your MongoDB, AWS, and OpenAI details
npm install
npm run dev           # Starts backend on http://localhost:5000
```

### **3. Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd client
cp env.example .env   # (Optional) Add frontend env vars if needed
npm install
npm start             # Starts React app on http://localhost:3000
```

## üåê **Cloud-Ready by Design**

- **All file uploads go to S3** (no more ‚Äúfile not found‚Äù on cloud hosts)
- **SPA routing works on Render, Netlify, Vercel, etc.**
- **Environment variables for all secrets/config**
- **Health and environment check endpoints for easy debugging**

---

## üí° **Why This Project Stands Out**

- **Real-world deployment:** Handles all the ‚Äúgotchas‚Äù of cloud hosting (ephemeral storage, CORS, HTTPS, etc.)
- **Modern, readable code:** Clean separation of concerns, clear naming, and comments where it matters
- **Extensible:** Easy to add new AI features, CRMs, or analytics
- **User-focused:** Fast, intuitive UI with clear feedback and error handling
- **Production-grade:** Security, error logging, and robust file handling

---

## üìä **Feature Highlights**

- **Audio/video upload** with drag-and-drop
- **AI transcription** (OpenAI Whisper)
- **Sentiment & insights analysis** (OpenAI GPT)
- **PDF & PPT generation** (one click, branded, and beautiful)
- **CRM sync** (Salesforce out of the box)
- **Analytics dashboard** (see trends, top HCPs, and more)
- **Role-based authentication** (easy to extend for real users)

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª **For Developers**

- **Easy to read, easy to extend:**  
  - Add new endpoints in `server/routes/`
  - Add new UI pages in `client/src/pages/`
- **Clear error messages and logs**
- **Ready for CI/CD and cloud deployment**
